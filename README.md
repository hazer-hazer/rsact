</div>

`rsact` is a GUI framework targeting embedded systems in Rust. The framework is based on fine-grained reactivity system, hence the name.
The project is split into these parts:

- [`rsact_reactive`](./rsact-reactive/README.md) fine-grained reactivity framework.
- [`rsact_ui`](./rsact-ui/README.md) the core of UI framework.
- [`rsact_icons`](./rsact-icons/README.md) tuned pre-rendered icons targeting tiny sizes.
- [`rsact-encoder`](./rsact-encoder/README.md) (_WIP_) widgets specific for platforms with encoder+button control.
- [`rsact-widgets`](./rsact-widgets/README.md) (_WIP_) high-level widget kinds such as drop-down list, menus, etc.
